        <h3>Discover the path toward your best hopes.</h3>
        <p>If you’re looking for compassion and the help of a trained counselor ready to listen and engage your personal story, you’ve come to the right place. Life can be hard, frustrating and painful – pain caused by our relationships, our bodies, or by seeing others suffer. We’ve all been in those places of suffering and loss and struggle, and all of us have found a way out, and that just makes us incredibly more beautiful.</p>

            <h3>My Approach</h3>
            <img id="headshot" src="media/stephanie_headshot.jpg" alt="Stephanie headshot" />
            <p>Solution-Focused Therapy allows me to celebrate people’s identity, strength, resourcefulness, determination, hope, and faith.</p>
            <p>Many clients come to therapy because they are traumatized (PTSD). Rather than reliving the trauma you have experienced, I will ask questions to help you recognize your own unique qualities and skills. My job is to help you see yourself as you really are so that you can become the best possible you – the person you are truly born to be.</p>
            <p>We will move forward at your own pace, in the areas that you choose to focus on.</p>

            <h3>Couples Therapy</h3>
            <p>Are you ready to experience a positive change in your relationship? My role is to help you and your partner to identify what you want your relationship to look like. We then work to identify steps that can be taken for your relationship to once again flourish.</p>
            <p>When things are going well, we forget to notice why and what we are doing to cause things to be so right. Together we’ll explore what you have done in the past and what you can do now to bring back your love and joy.</p>
            <p>My solution-focused therapy approach helps you learn what your skills are and how to move forward into the future with hope.</p>
